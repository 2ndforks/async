# ASyNC

An async framework for LuaJIT, based on [LibUV](https://github.com/joyent/libuv)
(using Tim Caswell's [luv](https://github.com/creationix/luv) library).

This lib is heavily inspired on the Node.js architecture. It's fun, elegant, and
should be extremely efficient (a lot of testing is required).
It is currently being used in production.
